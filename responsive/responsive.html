       <P>In the early 1990s, a teenager named Robert Earl Davis Jr. pioneered the DJ style known as “screwed and chopped” in a small apartment on the Southside of Houston, Texas. His friends already called him DJ Screw back then, but the world hadn’t yet learned about the quiet dude with the flat top and that big sound. Just a couple of years later, his music would become impossible to ignore around Houston. Over the next decade, Screw mixed and record hundreds 
           of “Screwtapes” with dozens of collaborators, birthing a legacy that would continue to grow long after his death in November 2000.</P>

     <p>One of the most uncomfortable things for me when I started getting booked for gigs was when promoters started asking for my “bio”.  The first time someone asked me for this, I went into an immediate panic.  Was this something I was supposed to have?  How do I go about bragging about myself?  Have I even accomplished enough to warrant a bio? 
          Do I write it in first person or third person?  Is someone else supposed to write it?  Where do I even begin?</p>
          <P>I recently realized that I’ve been doing this for years, and I don’t feel any less comfortable with handing out a bio.  But, it’s something that promoters ask for.  So, rather than continuing to ignore the problem, I decided to do some research on the subject and re-visit my own promotional blurb.  In this post, 
              I will teach you what I learned, and we will go through the process of re-writing my bio together.</P>
